For 3 straight days we tried to reach the airline and the web agent (e-dreams) and we did not get a solution. Finally, 18 hours before our cancelled flight time, and after 35 minutes on a call (waiting), the airline was able to get us on a flight with Lufthansa. Do not book Adria Airways, it is unreliable and in our case, it ruined our last days of holidays since we needed to be on the phones all day.   \n",

       "' We took 3 flights with Aegean and would not recommend them to anyone. Had 3 issues: 1. They overbooked our flight and bumped many people. We bought our flight 3 months ahead, but checked in about 18 hours before our flight (they allow check-in up to 24 hours ahead). We were issued a “standby” ticket without any seats. When we got to the gate, we were told we may or may not get onto the flight and if we didn’t then we would have to wait 4 hours for the late night flight, or try again in the morning. Lots of other people in the same situation. We were never issued boarding passes but we kept following up with the person at the ticket counter until they gave us passes, it seems like due to our persistence and nothing systematic. Luckily we got on that flight, but others didn’t. Nowhere in the policy does it say that whether or not you get on the flight is related to your check-in time. If you take Aegean, check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats! 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags, which fit easily into any overhead bin (including previous Aegean flights) were found to be slightly overweight (apparently 9kgs are allowed, ours were about 10kgs). We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse / backpack. They said no, they need to check the two bags, and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also, there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carry-ons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late. Two of three were late by over 45 mins. We didn’t have any connections, but I imagine many connecting flights were missed. And, this didn’t happen to us, but it’s worth noting that when we landed in Athens, there were about 30 people waiting at the lost baggage desk. Most of them looked very angry. I asked one person what happened, and apparently an entire flight did not have their bags transferred at a connection. So not only will they force you to check your carry-on and then pay for a checked bag, they might lose it too. All-in-all, this is a pretty bad track record for 3 short island hop flights.'"

No concern to at least call the customer and inform about the cancellation. Secondly, I was informed at the Go First counter on the same day 09/08/2021, that full amount will be refunded within 5 days which is yet not over for them I think.

There was confusion at this small airport. I was then directed to the office of AB Aviation which was still closed. It opened at 0900hrs and I was told that the flight had been put back to 1300hrs and that they had tried to contact me. This could not be true as they did not have my phone number. I was with a local guide and he had not been informed either. I presume that I was bumped off. The later flight did operate but as usual, there was confusion at check-in. The flight was only 30mins and there were no further problems. Not a good airline but it is the only one for Comoros.   \n",
